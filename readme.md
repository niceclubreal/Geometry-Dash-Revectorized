Everyone knows that RobTop doesn't want to release his art files, so it's up to us to recreate them in all of their vector glory.

**Geometry Dash Revectorized** is a collaboration project that focuses on vectorizing every asset that RobTop has created for Geometry Dash.

If you're interested in tracing assets for any of his other games, go to [others/](others/), where you and other people can help trace assets for Boomlings, Boomlings Matchup, and Memory Mastermind, as well as other beta assets, such as the Forlorn platformer buttons used in the Geometry Dash 2.2 alpha stage, the Level End trigger from 1.0-1.9, and other unused assets. You can find those in [others/betaAssets/](others/betaAssets/).

## Our goal
Our goal is to vectorize Geometry Dash assets for texture pack creators to 90%+ accuracy and make them open-source for everyone. Even the project logo is available to edit! [GJ_revectorizedLogo.fla](GJ_revectorizedLogo.fla)

## How you can contribute
If you want to help contribute, you can! Just create a fork of this repository, add your art file, then create a pull request. You can even submit a competitor to an original file - just add it as `[fileName]_compare`, and you can add more than one art file!

## Rules for contribution
* The file must be saved as an .fla.
  * Files can be saved as an .svg if it's really accurate.
* Files must have the original sheet name. For example, `GJ_GameSheet03.png` should be saved as `GJ_GameSheet03.fla`. Do not include the `-hd` or `-uhd` suffix.
  * If the files are standalone, like the `dialogIcon` images, the filename has to be something that says what the vectorized assets are - such as `dialogIcons.fla`.
* Images should not be vectorized by Adobe Animate's Trace button.
